Goal! The Dream Begins explores the power of Santiago's yearning and the things he learns on the path to fulfilling his dream. The story's moral message is that we can't do become the best we are meant to be without the love and enthusiasm of others. We think this is a point worth making in a time when the myth of individualism still holds sway.
Robert Muller has stated: "Have a dream and believe in it. Strong dreams always come true." Especially with a little help from people enthusiastically cheering us on from the sidelines.
